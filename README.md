# CS230-Project
Predicting wire-line logs from drilling data using inception CNN model with dropout. 

code reference: https://github.com/Ramesh-X/MNIST-CNN

We used different RNN models (GRNN, LSTM as well as clockwork RNN and compared the results with the inception CNN model)

## Data Processing:
Contains .m files used to process and augment the well logs to generate training examples.
