# Clockwork RNN

This is a **TensorFlow** implementation of the **Clockwork RNN** proposed by Koutnik et al. ([ICML](https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.3511), 2014). In addition to the model itself there is a small data generator for testing the prediction capability of the CW-RNN.

## Dependencies

* NumPy
* TensorFlow (tested with v1.0)
* Optionally MatplotLib and Pandas when using the data generator
